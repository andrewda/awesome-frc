The Awesome List [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/tree/master/code-of-conduct.md) applies to this repository. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you just created something, wait 30 days before submitting.** This is a list of important and Awesome FRC materials, not every small project every contributor has given. Similarly, please don't submit projects for which there's no plan of maintenance. If you're going to graduate next year and abandon your prokect, don't add it to this list.
- Some parts of this list are quite saturated. If you're planning to add your scouting app, it should offer something not covered by existing apps (a new platform or use case, for instance).
- If your submission is not your own work, search prior pull requests to check you're not duplicating a suggesion.
- If your submission is a GitHub repository, it should have a complete and well-written README, LICENSE file, and the like.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, recategorization of existing resources, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Neither poor spelling nor grammar will be tolerated in your changes or your project.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Your pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
